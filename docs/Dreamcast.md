_The Sega Dreamcast is a 6th generation home video game console released by Sega in 1998. It is notably the last console that Sega produced._

| Emulator | Rom Folder | Extension | BIOS |  Controller Config |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Reicast](https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator) | dreamcast  | .cdi .chd .gdi| dc_boot.bin, dc_flash.bin | /opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/mappings |

| [Redream](https://redream.io) | dreamcast  | .cue .cdi .chd .gdi | boot.bin (optional) | /opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/redream/mappings |


## Emulators: [Reicast](https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator), [lr-flycast](https://github.com/libretro/flycast.git), [Redream](https://redream.io)

Reicast can be very laggy and buggy, but some games work great. Pi 2 or later is required. 

Audio is choppy and not great, and degrades the longer the emulator is in use.  Restarting the emulator (and ultimately the Pi) may become a good idea after a couple hours of gameplay. There is a memory leak somewhere in the Reicast code. Low screen resolution are recommended to get best performance. Performance greatly suffers if HD resolutions are used.   

lr-flycast can be found in the _Optional_ packages section in the RetroPie Setup Script and on a Pi4 it has much better performance than Reicast.

Redream can be found in the _Experimental_ packages section and runs the best of the three options. However it can only be run on a Pi4 or a 64bit PC system, due to the OpenGL(ES)3 requirement.

## ROMS

Accepted File Extensions: **.cue .cdi .chd .gdi** for Dreamcast ROMs, **.zip** for Naomi/Atomiswave games.

Place your ROM files in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/dreamcast
```

## CHD files

All three emulators have support for the CHD (V5) archive format. This format will save space and allow you to keep your Dreamcast ROM folder tidy. See [Creating CHDs from CD-ROMS](CHD-files#creating-chds-from-cd-roms).

## BIOS

The BIOS files needed are: **dc_boot.bin, dc_flash.bin**. The boot file is often found named something else, such as dc_**bios**.bin. It must be renamed to dc_**boot**.bin when placed in the BIOS folder. lr-flycast has support for the Sega Naomi and Atomiswave arcade systems but you will also need the corresponding BIOS from the MAME romset.

Place your BIOS files in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS/dc
```

**Note:** If you are having trouble with having to set the date/time every time you load Reicast, [see this forum post](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/post/53941) for a guide on how to replace dc_flash.bin. The MD5 of the dc_flash.bin generated from that guide should be `2f818338f47701c606ade664a3e16a8a`.

**Note:** As of February 2019, the date/time prompt should appear only the 1st time Reicast is started.

RetroPie 4.0 uses an output resolution independent render resolution of 640x480. Open `/home/pi/.reicast/emu.cfg` to modify render resolution.

## Tweaks

## VMUs

### Reicast
VMUs are stored as .BIN files under `/home/pi/.reicast/`, and will be automatically created the first time you run Reicast without VMU files.  

On occasion, these VMUs do not get formatted quite right during creation, and the Dreamcast can't save or load data from them.  They just need to be reformatted -- run the `SYSTEMMANAGER` entry in the EmulationStation Dreamcast menu and / or see [this post](http://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/configuring-controllers-in-reicast/page/2/#post-99715) for details. 

### lr-flycast
VMUs are stored as .BIN files under `/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS/dc/`, and will be automatically created the first time you run lr-flycast.

There is an option for the core to enable `per-game` VMU's. This option is recommended if you have several games or a game that takes a large amount of space.

### Redream
VMUs are stored as `vmu[0-3].bin` files under `/opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/redream/`.

### Management

A Dreamcast soft-reset (A+B+X+Y+Start buttons at the same time) at the ROM's title screen will also take you into the Dreamcast BIOS to manage the VMU's. After formatting VMU's, exit the emulator and restart if using Reicast. Pressing 'Play' will cause Reicast to crash.

## Controls
Starting with RetroPie 3.3 controls for the Dreamcast Emulator are automatically configured when you configure your controls through emulationstation.
Please notice that you may be interested in disabled the input auto config ( described above ) in case of any autoconfig issue.

![sega_dreamcast_diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10035308/16599638/7f411634-42c0-11e6-811c-456f02b2ea47.png)

Controls can be mapped via the `/home/pi/.reicast/emu.cfg` file. Make sure that evdev_device_id_1 & evdev_device_id_2 are set to the corresponding controller's /dev/input/event* number you want to use. A -1 means no controller which we will use for player 3 and 4. Then have evdev_mapping_1 & evdev_mapping_2 point to the matching controller mapping configuration files and both can either point to the same file or different files if you want to use 2 different controllers types.

Here is an example of this:

```
[input]
evdev_device_id_1 = 2
evdev_device_id_2 = 3
evdev_device_id_3 = -1
evdev_device_id_4 = -1
evdev_mapping_1 = /opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/mappings/controller_Xbox360WirelessReceiver(XBOX).cfg
evdev_mapping_2 = /opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/mappings/controller_8BitdoSNES30GamePad.cfg
joystick_device_id = -1
```

If you want to be able to use 2 controllers at the same time, then you would add this section to the `emu.cfg` file:

```
[players]
nb = 2
```

In more recent builds of reicast, the +Start Reicast script launches a landing page with a game menu with containing a  'settings' button. Controllers can be mapped directly from the settings menu - this creates config files looking like:

```
/opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/mappings/evdev_Xbox360WirelessReceiver(XBOX).cfg
```

In stock configuration, access to this menu is controlled from the D-Pad of a controller with an analog stick. In the case where your controller does not have an analog stick, it may be necessary to connect one in order to access this part of the menu and create mappings for your other controllers.

Some example mappings are provided below for various controllers which can be directly edited from the 
```
/opt/retropie/configs/dreamcast/mappings/
```
Folder listed above.

An example mapping for a PS3 controller is below for reference:

**PlayStation 3 Controller**

```
[PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller]
button.0=Btn_Z
button.1=Btn_C
button.2=Btn_D
button.3=Btn_Start
button.4=DPad_Up
button.5=DPad_Right
button.6=DPad_Down
button.7=DPad_Left
button.8=Axis_LT
button.9=Axis_RT
button.10=DPad2_Left
button.11=DPad2_Right
button.12=Btn_Y
button.13=Btn_B
button.14=Btn_A
button.15=Btn_X
button.16=Quit
axis.0=Axis_X
axis.1=Axis_Y
```
If mapping is not working correctly try changing controller name for: 
```
[Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller]
```
For Wireless PS3 Controller use: 
```
[PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)]
```
Replace xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with your own controller mac address

Press ctrl+c to exit- Or map a Quit button (PS) as shown above :D

**Mapping a Nonstandard Controller via @Folly**

run in terminal :
```
cd /opt/retropie/emulators/reicast/bin
```

Here is a script called 'reicast-joyconfig'
run it :
```
./reicast-joyconfig
```

Choose your joystick.
Now you can map your buttons.
When all is done it outputs the text for making a file in `/home/pi/.reicast/mappings`.

It outputs something like this (numbers are in decimals not hexadecimal such as in other contollers' config file):

```
[emulator]
mapping_name = Your Gamepad
btn_escape = 316

[dreamcast]
.......etc
```

Create a file in `/home/pi/.reicast/mappings` called `controller_Your Gamepad.cfg` and paste the text in this file, then modify the `/home/pi/.reicast/emu.cfg` and reference this file in the **`evdev_mapping_1`** (change the number according to the player you want to configure) configuration option.
