_ScummVM stands for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (VM stands for virtual machine). ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files_

## Emulator: [ScummVM](http://scummvm.org/)

## ROMS
Accepted File Extensions: This is a tricky question as ScummVM has it's own particular filesets and method of loading- but when all is said and done **.sh .svm** are the filetypes EmulationStation will read.

ScummVM is very different to most romsets in that there are a set of files for each game. 

See the list here: http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles

Place Your folders of game files in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/scummvm
```

**Quick Start**

- Quit running rom without saving : Alt + X

- After you've added you files into the scummvm rom folder, open up the +LAUNCH GUI

- then hold down shift and click mass add

- Navigate to the scummvm folder and select it to add all of your files

- quit out of the GUI

- Press F4 to get out of emulationstation

- Type in emulationstation to open up emulationstation

- navigate to scummvm and your games will all be there on the list and you'll have no need of a GUI


## Troubleshooting

#### FUZZY MENU?

You can open the **options** in the scummvm launcher and change the graphics mode to **opengl** and it will make the menu and your games clear and crisp! There are also other rendering modes as well that can be changed.
