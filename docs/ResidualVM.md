## Emulator: [ResidualVM](https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm) (REMOVED Oct 2025, Experimental)

Initially a fork of [ScummVM](ScummVM) to allow playing the 3 games supported, it has been merged back to the parent project in 2021 and the games are playable in [ScummVM](ScummVM).

The emulator has been **removed** from RetroPie, use [ScummVM](ScummVM) instead.
