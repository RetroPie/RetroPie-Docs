If you're like me, there are some games I could just never win as a kid. This guide will finally allow you to win! (albeit with a much lesser sense of satisfaction)

## Download Cheats

As a preface cheats only work through libretro/retroarch so take note of the emulators you are using.

You first need to open the RGUI. There are two ways of accessing the RGUI:

- In the **RetroPie** menu of EmulationStation select **Retroarch**
or
- [Hotkey combination](Controller-Configuration#hotkey) **Hotkey+X** to open the RGUI from within a game

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to enable the advanced settings by navigating to **Settings >> User Interface >> Show Advanced Settings**, then enabling the Online Updater in **Settings >> User Interface >> Menu Item Visibility** by turning ON the **Show 'Online Updater'** option.

Next, navigate to **Online Updater >> Update Cheats** and this will download a set of preconfigured cheat files for many games into `/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/cheats`

### Enable Cheats

Now you can launch the game you want to finally win:

Open the RGUI with [Hotkey combination](Controller-Configuration#hotkey) **Hotkey+X**

Choose **Quick Menu >> Cheats >> Load Cheat File**

Navigate to your game title and select it

Then navigate to the cheat you want to enable and press left or right to toggle it on/off

Select **Apply Cheat Changes**

Then press **B** to go out of the cheat menu and **resume** your game.

Your cheats should now be enabled

### Create Cheat Files

You can create .cht files in `/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/cheats/<system>/<rom_name>.cht`
