	---  Db9 joystick driver for Raspberry Pi's GPIO v1.0 ---

1. Overview

The driver is designed to be used with db9 joysticks connected to Raspberry 
Pi's GPIO. Up to 2 joysticks of following types can be used with the driver:

	-Atari, Commodore, Amiga and other db9 multisystem joysticks (1-3 buttons) 
	-Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) gamepads
	-Sega Saturn controllers (Note: custom connector instead of db9)
	-Amiga CD32 gamepads
	
The driver is based on db9 kernel module for parport (see 
linux/Documentation/input/joystick-parport.txt), but uses different pinout and 
parameters. No warranty - use at your own risk.


2. Required hardware

-Raspberry Pi and supported joysticks
-One DB9 connector (male) per joystick, and wires (e.g. a ribbon cable)


3. Connecting the joysticks

RPi GPIO pinout: http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals
NOTE: the driver does not use pins which are assigned different GPIO IDs on 
different revision boards, so checking of board revision is not required.

The available GPIOs are divided into 2 ports, PORT1 and PORT2. Both use 7 data 
pins, which are listed below:

Button/Function     PORT1 GPIO ID	     PORT2 GPIO ID
UP 	                4 	                 15
DOWN 	            7 	                 17
LEFT 	            8 	                 18
RIGHT 	            9 	                 22
FIRE1 	            10 	                 23
FIRE2 / SELECT1     11                   24
FIRE3 / SELECT0     14                   25

Pins P1-01 (3.3V) and P1-06 (GND) are used as common power and ground for 
all joysticks. These supplies are also available on a few other pins (see 
the pinout), which can be helpful when multiple joysticks are used. Note 
that 3.3V is used instead of 5V, although all supported joysticks requiring 
power are designed for 5V. This is done to avoid addition of level shifters, 
since the GPIO pins on RPi use 3.3V logic levels and are not 5V tolerant.

Controllers using CMOS chips should function without an issue with 3.3V 
supply, but functionality of TTL-based joysticks cannot be guaranteed, 
although several controllers (e.g. Genesis) have been successfully tested 
with 3.3V supply. In case your controller does not work properly with 3.3V 
supply, you can switch to 5V supply if appropiate level shifters are added 
between output pins of joystick and GPIO input pins (see signal directions 
in the sections below). For example, 74LVC245 is an IC which can be used for 
this downconversion.

4. Configuring the driver

The driver is loaded and unloaded with command "modprobe" (as root or with 
sudo). It is recommended to use "--first-time" -option with modprobe since the 
default output is not very verbose (see "man modprobe").


4.1 Configuring the joysticks

The driver is loaded in the following way:

# modprobe --first-time db9_gpio_rpi map=<PORT1>,<PORT2>

, where <PORT1> and <PORT2> describe the joystick type connected to the 
corresponding port, which may be one of the following:
    
    0 = no connection
    1 = Multisystem 1-button joystick
    2 = Multisystem 2-button joystick
    3 = Multisystem 3-button joystick
    4 = Mega Drive (Genesis) standard pad (3+1 buttons)
    5 = Mega Drive (Genesis) 3rd-party pad (5+1 buttons)
    6 = Mega Dribe (Genesis) 6-button pad (6+2 buttons)
    7 = Sega Saturn controller (any type)
    8 = Amiga CD32 gamepad
	
For example, if a standard Mega Drive pad is connected to PORT1 and a Saturn 
controller to PORT2, the command would be
"modprobe --first-time db9_gpio_rpi map=4,7".

The following command can be used to verify if the correct controller was 
inserted to the intended port:
# tail /var/log/kern.log

If the joystick is swapped to another type while RPi is powered, it is 
recommended to unload the driver before (not after) swapping the controllers:
# modprobe --first-time -r db9_gpio_rpi
This sets GPIO pins configured to outputs (in previous setup) back to inputs.

When using modprobe, the configuration does not persist over reboots. To 
configure the driver to be loaded on startup, add the driver name and joystick 
map to /etc/modules (e.g. "db9_gpio_rpi map=4,7")


4.2 Testing the joysticks
# apt-get install joystick
# jstest /dev/input/jsX
	where X corresponds to the pad index (0-1)
