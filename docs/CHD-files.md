## CHD

CHD is a lossless compression format originally developed for MAME, for the hard-drive contents of certain arcade machines. It has since been used in several other emulators as a means of storing CD-ROM game data.

### Creating CHDs from CD-ROMs

The following archive contains a MAME 0.205 version of CHDMAN and Windows batch files that can be used to quickly convert your PSX games to CHD (V5): [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ElaPpvBHs5aUd0QUM3c05kY2c/view?usp=sharing)

Run the appropriate batch file in the same folder as the ROM(s) you wish to compress, and it will search subfolders for `.cue` files to compress. If a `.chd` is not generated after running the appropriate batch, then something is wrong with the ROM(s) `.cue`.
