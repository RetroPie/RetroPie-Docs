This emulator is **experimental** and can be installed from the optional menu of the [retropie setup script](Updating-RetroPie)

### Getting Started

You will need a keyboard and a mouse - gamepads will not work for this game

When you first start up the game you will be greeted by the following screen:

Download the graphics and then select check online content

If you don't have the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe files you'll want to at the very least download **OpenMSX** and **OpenSFX** packs so you have sound effects and music.

Once you've downloaded **OpenMSX** and **OpenSFX** you have to enable them in the game options as follows:

Then finally, in order to get your music playing you have to start a new game and turn on the jukebox:

_Optionally_, you can also download **zBase** for 32-bit HD graphics and change the Base graphics set in the game options to zBase instead of OpenGFX.
