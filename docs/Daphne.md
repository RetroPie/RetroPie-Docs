_Laserdiscs were predecessors to the DVD. The first laserdisc game was released in 1982. Laserdisc games function much like interactive fiction where you choose your own story and the video adapts to the path you choose to take._

## Emulator: [daphne](http://www.daphne-emu.com/site3/index_hi.php), [hypseus](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus-singe)

**daphne** was developed by Matt Ownby. For the best replication of Laserdisc games check out his Dexter project [HERE](http://www.daphne-emu.com/mediawiki/index.php/DexterFAQ)  
**hypseus** is a SDL2 fork of the Daphne codebase. This version includes **Singe** game support.

## ROMS

Accepted extensions: **.daphne**

Place your Laserdisc roms in 

```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/daphne
```

The file structure is like so:

### Daphne

```
roms
|-- daphne
|    |   (The folder below holds a laserdisc...".daphne"
|    |   tells emulationstation to add this to the menu,
|    |   and "dle21" tells daphne to use that game engine)
|    |
|    |-- dle21.daphne     
|    |    |-- dle21.commands  (Optional extra command-line params!)
|    |    |-- dle21.txt       (Framefile)
|    |    |-- lair.m2v
|    |    |-- lair.ogg
|    |
|    +-- roms                 (All roms go into this roms folder)
|         +-- dle21.zip
```
### Singe 
Only supported in **hypseus**. Ensure the main *.singe* file matches the game directory name.
```
roms
|-- daphne
|    |
|    |-- timegal.daphne
|    |    |
|    |    |-- timegal.commands  (Optional)
|    |    |-- timegal.txt       (Framefile)
|    |    |-- timegal.m2v
|    |    |-- timegal.ogg
|    |    |-- timegal.singe     (Main LUA Singe file)
|    |    |-- *.*               (Other peripheral files)
|    |
|    +-- roms                   (No Singe data but required)
|
```

Default **dapinput.ini**
```
# Daphne cutom keyboard and joystick mapping
#
# Each input is mapped to 2 keyboard keys and one joystick button.
# A joystick's first analog stick is also automatically mapped.
#
# The first two numbers are SDL keyboard codes (or 0 for "none")
# Find keyboard codes here:
# http://www.daphne-emu.com/mediawiki/index.php/KeyList
#
# The third number is the joystick button code (or 0 for "none")
# Since 0 is reserved for special meaning, joystick button 0 is identified
# as 1 here.  Button 1 is identified as 2, and so on.
# 
# Find the button you want to map by running:
# jstest /dev/input/js0

Default **hypinput.ini**

As of version **v2.10.1** of Hypseus Singe you are able to use the **SDL_GameController** API for configuration.  
This is enabled via the `-gamepad` argument.

```
# To use: Rename this file to hypinput.ini and use -gamepad
#
# Hypseus uses SDL2 Keycodes and SDL_GameController
# SWITCH = Key1 Key2 Joy (Axis)

# Available AXIS MACROS
#
# AXIS_LEFT_UP
# AXIS_LEFT_DOWN
# AXIS_LEFT_LEFT
# AXIS_LEFT_RIGHT
# AXIS_RIGHT_UP
# AXIS_RIGHT_DOWN
# AXIS_RIGHT_LEFT

Traditional Joystick API configuration is still *default*:

```
# The first two entries are SDL2 keyboard codes or names (0 for "none")
#
# Find SDL2 keyboard code information here:
# https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus-singe/blob/master/doc/keylist.txt
#
# Hypseus Singe supports configuration on multiple joysticks
# First joystick is defined as 0, second joystick as 1 etc.
#
# IMPORTANT: Find the joystick button and axis by running:
#
# Use the 'hypjsch' tool to help configure this file
# https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypjsch
# With this tool, you do not need to perform the +1 detailed in this file.
#
# Alternatively:
# jstest /dev/input/js0 || jstest /dev/input/js1
#
# The third number in config is a joystick button code (or 0 for "none")
# Since 0 is reserved for special meaning, joystick button 0 is
# identified as 1. Button 1 is identified as 2, and so on.
#
# Defining 001 (or 1) identifies first joystick(0) button 0
# Defining 111 identifies second joystick(1) button 10
#
# The fourth number in config (if specified) is the joystick axis
# configuration (or 0 for "none"). Since 0 is reserved for
# special meaning, joystick axis 0 is identified as 1.
# Axis 1 is identified as 2, and so on.
#
# Only the first four switches are defined (SWITCH_UP->SWITCH_RIGHT) for axis
#
# Defining -001 (or -1) identifies first joystick(0) axis 0 in negative direction
# Defining +102 identifies second joystick(1) axis 1 in positive direction

# KEY_BUTTON3 Turns scoreboard on/off in lair/ace

### Command Parametres

Example Dragon's Lair Commands file in

`/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/daphne/lair.daphne/lair.commands`

```
-nocrc -noissues -nolog -noserversend -latency 950 -x 640 -y 480 -bank 1 00110111 -bank 0 10011000
```

See [here](http://www.daphne-emu.com/mediawiki/index.php/CmdLine) for more **daphne** cmdline parameters. **hypseus** has extended parameters defined [here](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus-singe#extended-arguments-and-keys).

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues with black screen, try deleting the .dat file as it is generated the first time you parse the video files. If you transferred the .dat file from another system it may not work, so just leave the .dat file out.

It is also case sensitive so if it's not working try making the extensions in the .daphne file lowercase.
