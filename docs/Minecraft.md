_Minecraft was created by Markus "Notch" Persson and his company Mojang which was later sold to Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars- which explains why there has been pretty much no development on Minecraft Pi edition for more than 2 years now. Minecraft for Pi is based off of Minecraft Pocket Edition, and as such lacks creatures, adventures, night time, etc. It is unfortunately incredibly basic._

This emulator is experimental and can be installed from the experimental menu of the [retropie setup script](Updating-RetroPie). This cannot be installed on the Raspberry Pi 4 or 400.

**Important notes:** 

In order to work with fullscreen, a window manager called Matchbox is used, but it has a side effect of the mouse not quite working right in the menu so you need to use a keyboard to start up a world. Once you are in the world, the mouse works just fine. 

To exit, you can either click the x in the upper right of the screen or you can reboot your pi.
