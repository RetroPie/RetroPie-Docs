## ROMS

Accepted File Extensions: **.7z .ccd .chd .cue .pce .zip**

Place your PC Engine/PC Engine CD/TurboGrafx-16/TurboGrafx-CD/SuperGrafx ROMs in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/pcengine
```

## CHD Files

lr-beetle-pce-fast and lr-beetle-supergrafx have support for the CHD (V5) archive format. This format will save space and allow you to keep your PC Engine CD/TurboGrafx-CD ROM folder tidy. See [Creating CHDs from CD-ROMS](CHD-files.md#creating-chds-from-cd-roms).

## BIOS

**A BIOS file is only needed to play CD-based games.**

Several BIOS are supported, but **syscard3.pce** is the most compatible with games.

Recognized Name | No-Intro Name | CRC32 | MD5 | Comment |

## Controls

lr-beetle-pce-fast and lr-beetle-supergrafx utilise Retroarch configurations

```shell
/opt/retropie/configs/pcengine/retroarch.cfg
```
For more information on custom RetroArch controls see: [RetroArch Configuration](RetroArch-Configuration)

## PC Engine CD

It is important that the image file (usually `.bin`) and the CUE file (`.cue`) match.

CUE files are just text files containing a description of the CD. If you have files named like:

~~~
Akumajou Dracula X.bin
Akumajou Dracula X.cue
~~~

then ensure the first line of the CUE file contains:

~~~
FILE "Akumajou Dracula X.bin" BINARY
~~~

Any of the following are wrong and will not work:

~~~
### extension has incorrect case
FILE "Akumajou Dracula X.BIN" BINARY

### file name has incorrect case
FILE "AKUMAJOU DRACULA X.bin" BINARY

### does not match the actual file name
FILE "Akumajou_Dracula_X_-_Chi_no_Rinne_(NTSC-J)_[KMCD3005].bin" BINARY
~~~

## Advanced Configuration

### Switching Emulation Station to the TurboGrafx-16 logo:

If you are from the United States it is likely that you had the TurboGrafx-16 rather than the PC Engine. If you want EmulationStation to show the TurboGrafx-16 graphics instead of PC Engine then you should create a file /opt/retropie/configs/all/platforms.cfg with the following contents (note this requires at least v4.1.6 of the RetroPie-Setup script).

```
pcengine_theme="tg16"
```

Once this is done, please update any of the currently installed PC Engine emulators from RetroPie-Setup and Emulation Station will now use the TurboGrafx-16 logo.
