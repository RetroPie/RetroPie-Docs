_This project is the result of hard work from Miroof. https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads_
***

Install from the experimental menu of the setup script (may only work well with a rpi2)

## Usage

Once the nodejs application is launched, you just have to plug your gamepad controller by connecting your device on the same local network and by reaching the address _http://node_server_adress_ (i.e. your Raspberry Pi's IP address) on your choice of web browser (Chrome Mobile is recommended).

## Use it as a Smartphone Application (Chrome for Android)

**Note that you need to configure the virtual gamepad from emulationstation while in the web browser first BEFORE you create the application on your smartphone otherwise the input configuration in emulationstation will not work.** 

With the add to homescreen chrome feature, you can easily use virtual gamepads application without launching the browser each time you want to play.

With only 3 clicks, virtual gamepads web application becomes a standalone application.

Then a shortcut is added on your homescreen and the application will be launched outside the browser.

## Enjoy Haptic Feedbacks

Because it's difficult to spot the right place in a touch screen without looking at it, the touch zone of each button was increased. LT button was moved at the center of the screen to let as much space as possible for the joystick and avoid touch mistakes.

To know if we pressed a button with success, the web application provides an haptic feedback which can be easily deactivated by turning off the vibrations of the phone.

**You will need to configure your controller with EmulationStation and RetroArch just like you would any other controller.**


You can also install manually using these steps:

### Install Node.js

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_archive_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i node_archive_armhf.deb
rm node_archive_armhf.deb
```

:zap: if for whatever reason is returning Error 502 bad gateway you can follow [source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=130217)

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt install -y build-essential python-dev nodejs npm
```

### Update Node.js and NPM

```
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 9
sudo npm install -g npm
```

### Install Virtual Gamepad (Must Be Run As Root!)

```
sudo -i
cd /
git clone https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads
cd node-virtual-gamepads
npm install
```

### Enable Virtual Gamepad on Boot

```
sudo npm install pm2 -g
sudo pm2 start main.js
sudo pm2 startup
sudo pm2 save
```

In this way every time you turn your raspberry on an http server will show up in port 80.
Be sure to have your smartphone in the same network as the raspberry

After all this mess you will realize 2 things:
- **it's working!** but the inputs are sensitive to the **network delay**, therefore you cannot really play the games which requires fast interactions :unamused:
- i suggest you to buy a controller with usb. [link](https://www.androidcentral.com/best-raspberry-pi-controller)
