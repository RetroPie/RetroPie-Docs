## DOS/32A extender
As per Dosbox' documentation: [DOS/32A (DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender)](https://dos32a.narechk.net/index_en.html) is a free and open source software that can be used to replace the DOS4GW.EXE DOS Extender file that many DOS games use. Once a game uses this, it is expected to run faster and better in DOSBox. 

**Note**: **_not all games will work with DOS/32A_**. For example, Shadowcaster is incompatible with it because RAVEN.EXE run with DOS/32A is unable to find the A32SBDG.DLL file that is in the same directory, while with DOS4GW it can. 

[**DOS/32A compatibility list**](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/DOS-32A-compatibility-list)

Check [Dosbox' documentation](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/TOOLS:DOS32A) to get further information as well as a guide on how to proceed.

Once "patched" your file executable should look like this:
```
$ file hospital.exe
MS-DOS executable, LE executable for MS-DOS, DOS/32A DOS extender (embedded)
```

## Install Gravis Ultrasound (GUS)
DOSBox comes with **Gravis Ultrasound** support, but you need a little effort to set it up. It's worth it definitely as the difference with a SoundBlaster 16 is impressive (check that for yourself with a game like Rise of the Triad, it's night and day).
1. You must first find the GUS driver for Dosbox. As I'm not 100% sure about the legality of the file no link can be shared from this wiki. 
2. If you get the file it should typically be containing a "ULTRASND" folder with various files and folders within.
3. Simply copy that "ULTRASND" folder straight under your Retropie "roms" directory for Dosbox (default: roms/pc).
4. Edit the .conf of your game(s) and get to the `[gus]` section. Modify it this way:
```
[gus]
[...]
gus      = true
gusrate  = 44100
gusbase  = 240
gusirq   = 5
gusdma   = 3
ultradir = C:\ULTRASND
```
5. All left to do is to **configure the game with GUS as the soundcard for music and digital effects**. You can do that usually via `setup.exe` or `install.exe` located in your game's directory.

Note: it's ok to move the "ULTRASND" directory to another location. Just remember to "mount" it whenever you launch the game and to edit the `ultradir` path from `.conf` accordingly.

[List of DOS games with GUS support](https://www.mobygames.com/attribute/sheet/attributeId,20/).

[Thread](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=184969#p184969) to **fix** games relying on **Human Machines Interface/HMI setup**. Those will fail detection of GUS soundcard (like Terminator Future Shock, Daggerfall, Whitchaven, etc).

## Tips and tricks
With DOSbox on a **Pi3B+** without overclocking (stock) I was able to get up to **34000 cycles**. Meaning a solid equivalent of a good 486DX2 or even Pentium 60 according to [this page](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Performance). Below the `cpu` setting I'm currently using for the majority of games. Feel free to look at the [DOSbox' documentation](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Configuration:CPU) for further details.
```
[cpu]
cycles = max 95% limit 34000
```

Whenever a game is running **too fast** you'll have to rely on the `fixed` parameter of `cycles`. Good example with Wing Commander (1 and 2):
```
[cpu]
cycles = fixed 4000
```

## Troubleshooting

If the keyboard input in DOSBox is not correct, you need to edit the DOSBox config file, dosbox-SVN.conf, which is located in the hidden folder, .dosbox, in your home folder.

To fix, run the following commands:

    cd ~/.dosbox
    sudo nano dosbox-SVN.conf

In the [sdl] section, edit line 34 of dosbox-SVN.conf so that usescancodes is set to false as below:

    usescancodes=false

In some games your joystick/controller may be permanently fixed in one corner. For these games, edit dosbox-SVN.conf, find the [Joystick] section and set timed to false as below:

    timed=false

rpix86 defaults to analog audio output, if you use HDMI audio you need to give -a0 parameter to rpix86
