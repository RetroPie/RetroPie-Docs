## What is RetroPie?

RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi or PC into a retro-gaming machine. It builds upon Raspbian, EmulationStation, RetroArch and many other projects to enable you to play your favourite Arcade, home-console, and classic PC games with the minimum set-up. For power users it also provides a large variety of configuration tools to customise the system as you want.

RetroPie sits on top of a full OS, you can install it on an existing Raspbian, or start with the RetroPie SD image and add additional software later. It's up to you. 

## What is an Emulator?

An emulator is software that makes a computer behave like another computer, or in the case of RetroPie a computer that behaves like a video game console such as the Super Nintendo. The RetroPie SD image comes pre-installed with many different emulators. Additional emulators may be installed from within RetroPie.

## What are ROMs?

ROMs are digital versions of game cartridges. Loading up a ROM in an emulator is the equivalent of putting a cartridge in a game console. 

ROMs are copyrighted content and as such are not included with RetroPie.

## What is a BIOS?
A BIOS is a small piece of software that tells hardware how to work. Many emulators emulate their system's BIOS, but others require you to supply a BIOS file. If a BIOS is required, the emulator's page will say so.

BIOSs are also copyrighted and are therefore not included with RetroPie.
